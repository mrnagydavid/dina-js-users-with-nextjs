This project is a solution for the Digital Natives' [`js-users` assessment](https://github.com/digitalnatives/assessment/tree/main/js-users).

Deviations from the assessment task:

- The _new_ backend server is used by this solution which is not mentioned of the official assessment at the time of this writing.

## Pre-requisites

- [`node` and `npm`](https://nodejs.org)

## Running the project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
